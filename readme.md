#Chrome Sort

Chrome Sort is a Python library (for now) that gives the user access to the Chrome Sort algorithm.
Chrome Sort is based on the idea that if there is free ram available, then it will use that RAM. This
ideology comes from the a browser known as Google Chrome, based on the Chromium Project.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Chrome Sort

```bash
pip install ChromeSort
```

## Example Usage

```python

```
or

alist = [4, 9, 0, 45, 0, 1]
